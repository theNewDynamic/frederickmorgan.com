<strong>VI</strong><p>
				 A rose dawn, in smoke, over the East River:<br>
				 light is reflected from the keel of clouds<br>
				 along Park Avenue's soiled streaks of snow.<br>
				 My sense attends the shiftings of the cold.<p>
				 Something&mdash;something reaches out behind the semblance:<br>
				 dimness with claws, brutal and serene.<br>
				 The sun rises across pale roofs of asphalt.<br>
				 A car stops at the red on 95th, which clicks to green.<P>
</td></tr><tr><td>
				 A man with a briefcase hurries to the corner,<br>
				 hails a cab, speeds off in a spray of slush;<br>
				 the newspaper boy in scarlet stocking cap<br>
				 trundles his squeaking cart from block to block . . .<p>
				 How shall I fix your shape or speak your name,<br>
				 great glow-eyed Cat crouched at the roots of being?<br>
				 This traffic of shadows between dark and light<br>
				 obscures the pure insistence of your gaze.<p>
				 And yet, extended from invisible sunlight,<br>
				 it's straitly in that gaze the shadows live,<br>
				 rehearse the permutations of their fates<br>
				 and win such vision as may view themselves.<p>
				 Somewhere, in an antiworld,<br>
				 a man has risen and looks out from his window;<br>
				 his face is mine, but if we should shake hands<br>
				 all worlds, thoughts, gods would find their fiery end,<p>
				 being reduced to simplicity,<br>
				 God, who are Any, All and None &mdash; in one.<br>
				 Now, please, retire; and claws be sheathed.<br>
				 Cold and bright the day's begun.<p>
