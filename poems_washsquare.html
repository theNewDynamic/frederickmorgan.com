<strong>Washington Square</strong><p>
Late in the twenties when I was small<br>in breezy spring and sullen fall<br>I walked each day to Washington Square<br>to play with other children there:<br><span class="poemindent">Paul, the minister's son,</span><br><span class="poemindent">Laura, who loved to run,</span><br>Benjamin with his costly toys,<br>and Sue, who said she hated boys.<p>Near the north entrance to the park<br>we'd meet at noon and play till dark<br>wide-ranging through those endless hours<br>as though all time and space were hours&mdash;<br><span class="poemindent">for when we five combined</span><br><span class="poemindent">we paid the hours no mind</span><br>so dazzled were we by the maze<br>of wonders opening to our gaze.<p>Each day that passed revealed a world&mdash;<br>a landscape secretly unfurled<br>to our five pairs of eyes alone.<br>As king or queen each ruled his own<br><span class="poemindent">in turn, day after day</span><br><span class="poemindent">in strict sequence and sway,</span><br>and fixed its boundaries and decreed<br>the laws which all the rest must heed.<p>For justice governed all our play:<br>no single passion might outweigh<br>the claims of all to equal share<br>in treasure unforeseen and rare.<br><span class="poemindent">And so we roamed at ease</span><br><span class="poemindent">through joyful seigneuries</span><br>each vassal proven by the sword<br>loyal to Lady or to Lord.<p>I still recall those ancient games!&mdash;<br>the talismans, the secret names,<br>the questing knights and demoiselles<br>the wizards weaving crafy spells,<br><span class="poemindent">and best of all our fair</span><br><span class="poemindent">strong fortress-castle, where</span><br>tired and exultant, friend by friend<br>we met at each adventure's end.<p>So the weeks passed&mdash;until one day<br>when I arrived at noon to play<br>near the great Arch, at the usual place,<br>I found no welcoming form or face:<br><span class="poemindent">no comrade had appeared.</span><br><span class="poemindent">I waited, watched and feared&mdash;</span><br>then wandered, aimlessly alone,<br>up and down those paths of stone.<p><em>This</em> was a world, it seemed, this bare<br>immensity where here and there<br>dim random shapes loomed into view&mdash;<br>this was the world that strangers knew.<br><span class="poemindent">I, its frailest part</span><br><span class="poemindent">received it from the start</span><br>as closer to the quick of things<br>than all our brave imaginings.<p>I stared straight up at the pale sky<br>where hulks of cloud went drifting by<br>and knew myself alone and pure.<br>"Whatever comes, you shall endure,"<br><span class="poemindent">a voice spoke inwardly,</span><br><span class="poemindent">a voice not strange to me.</span><br>I tracked my hand across my face<br>and felt the world shift in its place.<p>Next day all seemed restored. My four<br>good friends returned&mdash;we roamed once more,<br>releasing brighter energies<br>as though we'd found new selves to please.<br><span class="poemindent">Thus other months sped by</span><br><span class="poemindent">and seasons changed, as I,</span><br>aware that all must pass away,<br>lived on intensely day to day.<p>Comrades!&mdash;how has life served you all?<br>Benjy grew up a drunkard, Paul<br>was killed in Normandy, and Sue<br>moved somewhere west, was lost from view.<br><span class="poemindent">Sweet Laura, first to go</span><br><span class="poemindent">died of the polio</span><br>in '33&mdash;my loved, aged ten.<br>Sometimes I wish you back again,<p>the four of you, just as you were,<br>triumphant in that eager stir<br>of childhood&mdash;and myself with you<br>as I was then . . . But it won't do.<br><span class="poemindent">No dream of holding fast</span><br><span class="poemindent">to a beloved past</span><br>can cloud the heads of those who know<br>what's dead is dead, and rightly so.<p>Children still play in Washington Square<br>but they don't roam free, they must beware&mdash;<br>gone is their ancient liberty.<br>Gone, too, that civic decency<br><span class="poemindent">which cherished old and young</span><br><span class="poemindent">who shared the common tongue</span><br>America bows to new, weak gods;<br>its children play against the odds.<p>Laura, Benjamin, Paul and Sue,<br>you've gone your ways. I'm going, too.<br>Our early joys were dearly bought&mdash;<br>the world was never what we thought&mdash;<br><span class="poemindent">and yet, we're justified:</span><br><span class="poemindent">it wasn't we who lied.</span><br>Now leave me, friends, and leaving, bless.<br>Once more I face the emptiness.<p>
