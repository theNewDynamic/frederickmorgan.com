				 <strong>"When it rained and rained"</strong><p>When it rained and rained<br>and I was a child<br>I looked from the windows<br>Of "39"<br>across the slick street and<br>over the roofs<br>of three-storey houses&mdash;<br>brick and white trim&mdash;<br>hushed in the wetness<br>while high in the distance<br>above dim facades<br>water-towers loomed . . .<p>until the front door<br>three flights below<br>slammed, and my father's voice<br>rhythmic, searching<br>rose up the stairwell<br>calling a name,<br>the name that was mine&mdash;<p>and I cried out too<br>naming him back<br>in our secret tongue<br>and ran down the deep<br>stairway to find him:<br>we met at the heart<br>of the darkening house<p>as evening set in . . . Soon<br>the lights would go on.<p><br>


<strong>Hideyoshi</strong><p>After the last battle,<br>the enemy having been cut to pieces,<br>he rode a short distance from the field<br>and dismounted.<p>Sat in his armor on the grass<br>and gave word to his staff<br>that he wished to make a flower-arrangement&mdash;<br>they, however, lacked the equipment.<p>So he took a bucket, and his horse's bit<br>(which he hung by one ring from the bucket-handle)<br>and rigged them into a flower-holder,<p>then with his bloody sword<br>cut wild blossoms and grasses<br>and in an hour's silence<br>composed a subtle and delicate combination . . . <p>Those whom he had conquered<br>he must now judge;<br>he wished a mind clean-purged<br>of violence and ardor.<p>
