"No American poet since Whitman has written so profoundly and eloquently about death. In poem after poem Morgan movingly faces his own dying, weaving new myths from Eastern and Christian sources, probing his own past and dreams . . . Written in loneliness and love, <em>Death Mother</em> deserves to be read by anyone serious about his or her own unfolding story." &mdash;James Finn Cotter, <em>America</em>

<p>"Morgan is that rare thing&mdash;a poet of intelligence who is also a good <em>writer</em> . . . He is a poet whose continuing development should be watched by anyone who is concerned about the future of American poetry." &mdash;Richard Tillinghast, <em>The Sewanee Review</em>

<p>"<a href="http://www.danagioia.net/essays/emorgan.htm"><em>Death Mother and Other Poems</em> is Morgan's best collection to date and confirms that he has become a stronger poet with each succeeding volume.</a>" &mdash;Dana Gioia<p>
