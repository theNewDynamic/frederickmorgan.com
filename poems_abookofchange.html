				<strong>XXXVII</strong><p>
				Sometimes I hear my father's voice, sometimes my son's, in mine:<br>
the modulations of two who have died&mdash;<br>
passing beyond these tides of being.  Gone,<p>
but still their forms appear as though in sudden shafts of sun:<br>
Dad in the corner at "39"<br>
smoking his pipe; John standing at my desk<p>
smiling, talking to me of school, or work, or politics.<br>
Both of them are real to me today,<br>
more real than half the people whom I meet,<p>
as if their being, somehow, is in very loss confirmed.<br>
Reality may be a being in mind<br>
and who knows at what point the mind has end?<p>
The world that is not here may be a world of sun and trees,<br>
a world of man's potentialities:<br>
our absences may there be presences.<p>
Perhaps, in the long run, all mind, all memory is shared<br>
just as the body's basic stuff is shared<br>
that crumbles and renews, as time moves on<p>
(illusive time&mdash;whose motion may be but a long day's dream!)<br>
in other bodies, other being.  Yes,<br>
likely we are one substance, of which mind<p>
matter, are forms.  Voices of past and future speak in ours<br>
and somewhere, all is known&mdash;as I know now<br>
father's and son's reality in me.<p>
