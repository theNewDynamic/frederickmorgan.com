". . . a poet whose continuing development should be watched by anyone who is concerned about the future of American poetry" &mdash;Sewanee Review<p>

"There is in this body of work a security, a deep holding, so certain of its accuracy and strength that it can release (and find) a range of feelings of a richness unprecedented in our times." &mdash;A.R. Ammons<p>

"Frederick Morgan writes like no other poet in the United States . . . His poems of contemporary life are memorable for their knottiness of thought and sound, and at times a wonderful tenderness. One thinks of Thomas Hardy, but comparisons are misleading&mdashMorgan has been developing along the line of his temperament as only the very best poets do." &mdash;Louis Simpson<p>

"Morgan's poetry is finally religious poetry in the very best sense of the word: it transcends all parochial boundaries and works through the quiet compelling music of its language, to affirm the human spirit." &mdash;Joyce Carol Oates<p>
