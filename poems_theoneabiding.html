				<strong>The Parting</strong><p>
				I stood in the pine wood waiting for my friend<br>
				by the path along the water&mdash;<br>
				night falling, one last lobster boat<br>
				throbbing in from the bay.<br>
				I wished to say farewell, <em>bonne chance!</em><br>
				I did not expect to see this man again.<p>
				"It's the end, I guess," he said, "but first<br>
				I'm glad we can share such a moment.<br>
				You've loved this place for years, quite as much as I<br>
				and must surely know what I'm feeling<br>
				now that my time has come to leave it behind.<br>
				What a heart-breaking sunset! Yes, I'm glad you're with me . . . <p>
				Still, you'll agree, I haven't been lucky here,<br>
				and maybe this moving on will help me find<br>
				whatever it is I've wanted.<br>
				I feel like being alone high up in the mountains&mdash;<br>
				the Rockies, maybe, or Tibet:<br>
				I might come upon something like truth&mdash;and if I die, so be it."<p>
				We watched the swollen sun sink redly seaward<br>
				and stood for a time not speaking&mdash;then shook hands.<br>
				"Goodbye," I said. "Prevail.<br>
				May life serve you well while it lasts!<br>
				I know you and I will be called as one, in the end."<br>
				He smiled . . . I pulled from my hip the flask of brandy<br>
				and we each took a sip before he turned and went.<p>
